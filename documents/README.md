The Malkman project is designed to provide a complete, standalone audio playback system with interactive features and visual feedback. Utilizing the STM32F411E-Disco board, a GPD2846A MP3 decoder module, Neopixel RGB LED strip, and various input/output peripherals, this project aims to deliver an engaging and versatile audio experience. The system supports MP3 playback from an SD card and offers intuitive user controls.

*  See our [document](./features.md), [system architecture]() and [system design]() for more details .


## Features
The MP3 Player includes features such as:

1. **MP3 Playback:** Users can play MP3 files stored on a MicroSD card and control playback with basic operations: play, pause, resume, stop.
2. **Track Navigation:** Users can navigate between tracks using next and previous controls.
3. **Volume Control:** Users can adjust the volume using buttons or a rotation sensor.
4. **Track Information Display:** The player will display the current track information on the screen.
<!--5. **Visual Effects:** Use a Neopixel RGB light strip to provide visual feedback based on the audio signal.-->
