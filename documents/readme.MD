The MP3 Player project is designed to provide a complete, standalone audio playback system with interactive features and visual feedback. Utilizing the STM32F411E-Disco board, a GPD2846A MP3 decoder module, Neopixel RGB LED strip, and various input/output peripherals, this project aims to deliver an engaging and versatile audio experience. The system supports MP3 playback from an SD card, offers intuitive user controls, and integrates a visualizer to enhance the listening experience.
